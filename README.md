# Bandgap Reference
The project is about simulating Bandgap Reference circuit (BRG) and obtain its characteristics. 

*This project is now in its starting phase which involves working in Windows using Multisim* 

## About Multisim

Multisim™ software integrates industry-standard SPICE simulation with an interactive schematic environment to instantly visualize and analyze electronic circuit behavior developed by National Instruments.

 - Unzip NI_Circuit_Design_Suite_14_1_Education.zip
 - Click on setup.exe to install. 

Steps for viewing circuit and simulation using above files
===================================

1. Open NI Multisim 14.1 from start menu.
   - Schematics are saved in .ms14 format.
2. Download the BGR.ms14 file from this repository.
3. To open this file go to
   `File -> Open -> choose schematic file BGR.ms14`
   The circuit will show up in the editor. 
4. To change simulation parameters go to ` Simulate -> Analyses and simulation` and set parameters. 
5. To directly run and see simulation results go to `Simulate -> Run `
   Outputs will be shown on simulation window.
6. To extract spice netlist
   `Transfer -> Export SPICE Netlist -> Save` (save in .cir extension)
