# Bandgap_Reference_files
The project is about developing Bandgap Reference circuit (BRG) from opensource tools.

Steps for viewing circuit and simulation using above files
===================================
1. First install NI Multisim from NI website "https://www.ni.com/en-in/shop/electronic-test-instrumentation/application-software-for-electronic-test-and-instrumentation-category/what-is-multisim/multisim-education.html" and get student edition. 
2. Then open NI Multisim 14.1 from start menu.
3. Schematics are saved in .ms14 format.
4. Download the BGR.ms14 file from this repository.
5. To open this file go to
   `File -> Open -> choose schematic file BGR.ms14`
   The circuit will show up in the editor. 
6. To change simulation parameters go to ` Simulate -> Analyses and simulation` and set parameters. 
7. To directly run and see simulation results go to `Simulate -> Run `
   Outputs will be shown on simulation window.
8. To extract spice netlist
   `Transfer -> Export SPICE Netlist -> Save` (save in .cir extension)
